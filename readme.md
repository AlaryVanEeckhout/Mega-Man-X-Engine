## Mega Man X Engine  
Mega Man X Engine is a framework being developed using GameMaker (formerly GameMaker Studio 2) that contains a lot of features Mega Man X games have already implemented so you don't have to start it from scratch, plus new assets showing what can be done with the engine.  
Current version: v1.2.1.6  

GameMaker Runtime version: v2023.6.0.139.

Note: this engine is not complete yet, we recommend using it only if you are practicing or really know what you are doing.
